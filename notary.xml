        &lt;h1>Notary Services&lt;/h1>
        &lt;p>I am a Notary Public in the state of California. If you have documents that you need notarized and are in Davis, then email me at &lt;a href="mailto:larobitrumpet@lucyrobillard.xyz">larobitrumpet@lucyrobillard.xyz&lt;/a> and I can get your documents notarized. If you want to use a ProtonMail account instead, you can email me at &lt;a href="mailto:larobitrumpet@protonmail.com">larobitrumpet@protonmail.com&lt;/a>. The maximum fee allowed by the state of California is $15 per signature, although I can charge less.&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>I am not an attorney and, therefore, cannot give legal advice about immigration or any other legal matters.&lt;/p>
